# Porfolio
Thank you for visiting my porfolio page! This is a place where I continue to gather and post some of my skills and accomplishments.

[You may also find my resume here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LKi49g8pl9S7DhcJ_kRN7VdZnrS_648mi2wNJ2usF2w/edit?usp=sharing "Andre Entrekin's CV")

## Table of Contents:
Usage
Future Updates
Thanks

## Usage
The site is a single page portfolio allowing for all of my works to be visible without having to click through multiple pages.

## Future Updates
In the future, I will be adding on an extra page just for my photos since there are way too many to be shown on just a single page that is not solely dedicated to photos

## Thanks to
Mert Cukuren https://codepen.io/knyttneve/pen/YgZbLO for some css design tools used on the photography section.

Kilian Kremer, Lukasz Szmigiel, Sebastian Unrau, Veeterzy Smqil for the use of their photos as background images.
